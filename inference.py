        The transition model is not entirely stationary: it may depend on
        Pacman's current position (e.g., for DirectionalGhost).  However, this
        is not a problem, as Pacman's current position is known.

        In order to obtain the distribution over new positions for the ghost,
        given its previous position (oldPos) as well as Pacman's current
        position, use this line of code:

          newPosDist = self.getPositionDistribution(self.setGhostPosition(gameState, oldPos))

        variable that you have used to refer to the previous ghost position for
        which you are computing this distribution. You will need to compute
        multiple position distributions for a single update.

        newPosDist is a util.Counter object, where for each position p in
        self.legalPositions,

        newPostDist[p] = Pr( ghost is at position p at time t + 1 | ghost is at position oldPos at time t )

        (and also given Pacman's current position).  You may also find it useful
        to loop over key, value pairs in newPosDist, like:

          for newPos, prob in newPosDist.items():
            ...

        *** GORY DETAIL AHEAD ***

        As an implementation detail (with which you need not concern yourself),
        the line of code at the top of this comment block for obtaining
        newPosDist makes use of two helper methods provided in InferenceModule
        above:

          1) self.setGhostPosition(gameState, ghostPosition)
              This method alters the gameState by placing the ghost we're
              tracking in a particular position.  This altered gameState can be
              used to query what the ghost would do in this position.

          2) self.getPositionDistribution(gameState)
              This method uses the ghost agent to determine what positions the
              ghost will move to from the provided gameState.  The ghost must be
              placed in the gameState with a call to self.setGhostPosition
              above.

        It is worthwhile, however, to understand why these two helper methods
        are used and how they combine to give us a belief distribution over new
        positions after a time update from a particular position.

        Each particle is a tuple of ghost positions. Use self.numParticles for
        the number of particles. You may find the `itertools` package helpful.
        Specifically, you will need to think about permutations of legal ghost
        positions, with the additional understanding that ghosts may occupy the
        same space. Look at the `itertools.product` function to get an
        implementation of the Cartesian product.

        Note: If you use itertools, keep in mind that permutations are not
        returned in a random order; you must shuffle the list of permutations in
        order to ensure even placement of particles across the board. Use
        self.legalPositions to obtain a list of positions a ghost may occupy.

        Note: the variable you store your particles in must be a list; a list is
        simply a collection of unweighted variables (positions in this case).
        Storing your particles as a Counter (where there could be an associated
        weight with each position) is incorrect and may produce errors.

        To loop over the ghosts, use:

          for i in range(self.numGhosts):
            ...

        A correct implementation will handle two special cases:
          1) When a ghost is captured by Pacman, all particles should be updated
             so that the ghost appears in its prison cell, position
             self.getJailPosition(i) where `i` is the index of the ghost.

             As before, you can check if a ghost has been captured by Pacman by
             checking if it has a noisyDistance of None.

          2) When all particles receive 0 weight, they should be recreated from
             the prior distribution by calling initializeParticles. After all
             particles are generated randomly, any ghosts that are eaten (have
             noisyDistance of None) must be changed to the jail Position. This
             will involve changing each particle if a ghost has been eaten.

        self.getParticleWithGhostInJail is a helper method to edit a specific
        particle. Since we store particles as tuples, they must be converted to
        a list, edited, and then converted back to a tuple. This is a common
        operation when placing a ghost in jail.

        Then, assuming that `i` refers to the index of the ghost, to obtain the
        distributions over new positions for that single ghost, given the list
        (prevGhostPositions) of previous positions of ALL of the ghosts, use
        this line of code:

             setGhostPositions(gameState, prevGhostPositions), i, self.ghostAgents[i]
          )

        Note that you may need to replace `prevGhostPositions` with the correct
        name of the variable that you have used to refer to the list of the
        previous positions of all of the ghosts, and you may need to replace `i`
        with the variable you have used to refer to the index of the ghost for
        which you are computing the new position distribution.

        As an implementation detail (with which you need not concern yourself),
        the line of code above for obtaining newPosDist makes use of two helper
        functions defined below in this file:

          1) setGhostPositions(gameState, ghostPositions)
              This method alters the gameState by placing the ghosts in the
              supplied positions.

          2) getPositionDistributionForGhost(gameState, ghostIndex, agent)
              This method uses the supplied ghost agent to determine what
              positions a ghost (ghostIndex) controlled by a particular agent
              (ghostAgent) will move to in the supplied gameState.  All ghosts
              must first be placed in the gameState using setGhostPositions
              above.

              The ghost agent you are meant to supply is
              self.ghostAgents[ghostIndex-1], but in this project all ghost
              agents are always the same.
